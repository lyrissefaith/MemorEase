# MemorEase
MemorEase was born from our time studying abroad in Korea, where we our team met, made incredible memories and wanted a creative way to capture them. Traditional photo-sharing platforms felt limiting, and we realized that there wasn’t a solution on the market that allowed for fully customizable, collaborative scrapbooks. So, we decided to create one ourselves—a place where people can relive and share memories in a more engaging and personal way.

MemorEase lets users create digital scrapbooks with complete customization. Users can personalize covers, layouts, and media, including photos, videos, and notes. They can add soundtracks or playlists, either manually or through AI recommendations based on the scrapbook’s theme. Users can collaborate with friends in real-time and share their projects publicly. Additionally, MemorEase provides a public gallery where users can explore other scrapbooks for inspiration.
